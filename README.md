# GOST-block-cipher
GOST block cipher (GOST 28147-89) algorithm implementation using C++ language with WinApi UI.

The GOST block cipher, defined in the standard GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830), is a Soviet and Russian government standard symmetric key block cipher with the block size of 64 bits, published in 1989.

This is an encryption (decryption) program I wrote at my university within information security course.

The program is about encrypting and decrypting files using GOST block cipher. it implements three working modes:

1. data encryption (decryption) in the electronic codebook (ECB) mode,
2. data encryption (decryption) in the counter (CNT) mode,
3. data encryption (decryption) in the cipher feedback (CFB) mode.

How compile/run program:
1.	Open the solution in Visual Studio
2.	Run the program
