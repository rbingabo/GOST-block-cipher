# GOST-block-cipher
GOST block cipher (GOST 28147-89) algorithm implementation using C++ language with WinApi UI.

This is an encryption (decryption) program I wrote at my university within information security course.

The program is about encrypting and decrypting files using GOST block cipher. it implements three working modes:
•	data encryption (decryption) in the electronic codebook (ECB) mode,
•	data encryption (decryption) in the counter (CNT) mode,
•	data encryption (decryption) in the cipher feedback (CFB) mode.

How compile/run program:
1.	Open the solution in Visual Studio
2.	Run the program
